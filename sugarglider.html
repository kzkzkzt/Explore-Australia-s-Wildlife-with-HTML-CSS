          <h2>Habitat</h2>
          <p>
            Sugar gliders are distributed in the coastal forests of southeastern
            Queensland and most of New South Wales. Their distribution extends
            to altitudes of 2000m in the eastern ranges. The sugar glider occurs
            side-by-side with the squirrel glider and yellow-bellied glider and
            their coexistence is harmonious due to each species implementing
            different patterns of resource use. Like all arboreal, nocturnal
            marsupials, sugar gliders are active at night and they shelter
            during the day in tree hollows lined with leafy twigs. The average
            home range of sugar gliders is 1/2 hectare and is largely dependent
            on available food sources while density ranges from 2 to 6
            individuals per hectare. Native owls are their primary predators but
            also include kookaburras, goannas, snakes and quolls. Feral cats
            also represent a significant threat.

          <h2>Conservation</h2>
          <p>
            Under the prior taxonomy, the sugar glider was not considered
            endangered and its conservation rank was "Least Concern (LC)" on the
            IUCN Red List. However, with newer studies indicating that it has a
            small and restricted range, it is now thought to be far more
            sensitive to potential threats. For example, the species native
            range was hit hard by the 2019-20 Australian bushfires, which
            occurred just a few months prior to the publishing of the study
            indicating the true extent of its range. Sugar gliders use tree
            hollows, making them especially sensitive to intense fires. However,
            despite the loss of natural habitat in Australia over the last 200
            years, it is adaptable and capable of living in small patches of
            remnant bush, particularly if it does not have to cross large
            expanses of cleared land to reach them. Sugar gliders may persist in
            areas that have undergone mild/moderate selective logging, as long
            as three to five hollow bearing trees are retained per hectare.
            Although not currently threatened by habitat loss, the ability of
            sugar gliders to forage and avoid predators successfully may be
            decreased in areas close to humans.

          <h2>Torpor</h2>
          <p>
            In cold weather, sugar gliders will huddle together to avoid heat
            loss and will enter torpor to conserve energy but huddling as an
            energy conserving mechanism is not as efficient as torpor. Before
            entering torpor, a sugar glider will reduce activity and body
            temperature to lower energy expenditure and avoid torpor. With
            energetic constraints, the sugar glider will enter daily torpor
            between 2 and 23 hours while in rest phase. Torpor differs from
            hibernation in that torpor is usually a short-term daily cycle.
            Entering torpor saves energy for the animal by allowing its body
            temperature to fall to a minimum of 10.4°C to 19.6°C. When food is
            scarce, as in winter, heat production is lowered to reduce energy
            expenditure. With low energy and heat production, it is important
            for the sugar glider to peak its body mass by fat content in the
            autumn (May/June) to survive the following cold season. In the wild,
            sugar gliders enter daily torpor more often than sugar gliders in
            captivity. The use of torpor is most frequent during winter, likely
            in response to low ambient temperature, rainfall and seasonal
            fluctuation in food sources.

          <h2>General Facts</h2>
          <p>
            The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) is a small, omnivorous,
            tree-dwelling and nocturnal gliding possum belonging to the
            marsupial family. The common name refers to its predilection for
            sugary foods such as sap and nectar and its ability to glide through
            the air, much like a flying squirrel. They have very similar habits
            and appearance to the flying squirrel, despite not being closely
            related. The scientific name, Petaurus breviceps, translates from
            Latin as "short-headed rope-dancer", a reference to their canopy
            acrobatics. The sugar glider is characterized by it's pair of
            gliding membranes, known as patagia, which extend from its forelegs
            to its hindlegs. Gliding serves as an efficient means of reaching
            food and evading predators. The animal is covered in soft, pale grey
            to light brown fur, which is counter shaded, being lighter in color
            on its underside.

          <h2>Diet</h2>
          <p>
            Sugar gliders are seasonally adaptive omnivores with a wide variety
            of foods in their diet and mainly forage in the lower layers of the
            forest canopy. Sugar gliders may obtain up to half their daily water
            intake through drinking rainwater, with the remainder obtained
            through water held in its food. In summer they primarily eat insects
            and during the winter when insects are scarce, they mostly feed on
            saps from different plants. To obtain sap or gum from plants, sugar
            gliders will strip the bark off trees or open holes with their teeth
            to access stored liquid. They are opportunistic feeders and can be
            carnivorous, preying mostly on lizards and small birds. They eat
            many other foods when available, such as nectar, acacia seeds, bird
            eggs, pollen, fungi and native fruits. Pollen can make up a large
            portion of their diet, therefore sugar gliders are likely to be
            important pollinators of many plants.
