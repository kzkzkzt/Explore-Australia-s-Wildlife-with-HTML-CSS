In all species, the female has a well-developed scrotum that opens forward and contains four teats. 
Around the edge of the scrotum is a muscle that can be tightened to close it. 
The female mates shortly after birth, but the fetus goes into hibernation (diapause) until the young leave the pouch. The female usually becomes sexually mature around one year of age, while the male takes longer. 
In large kangaroos, the male does not become sexually mature until he is close to two years old. In the female, only one egg matures at a time, and thus only one young is born. However, twins can rarely occur in some species."

        red kangaroos in Australia as there are humans There are many different
        species of kangaroo, in fact as many as 11 genera and 51 species! Red
        giant kangaroo is the largest. The big red kangaroo stands
        upright on two legs. It has small front legs that it uses to eat and two
        large hind legs that it uses to jump long distances, usually 8-9 metres.
        The long tail has strong muscles, and is used as a counterweight when
        the kangaroo jumps quickly. The kangaroos also use their tail as an
        extra limb when walking slowly."
