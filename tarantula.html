				but are not found in the southern coastal areas or northern tropics. 
				Selenotypus are found in the Northern Territory and Selenotholus are found in north-western Queensland.

				Tarantulas do not make webs in the way you think of other spiders. If you imagine a giant cliched spider web like in the movies with a giant, hairy, colorful, tarantula in the center of it, you would be disappointed.
				Tarantulas build burrows. When they hunt, they go out and pounce upon prey rather than trapping them in their webs. They do not build webs, although they do still spin spider silk.
				Tarantulas use their spider silk to line portions of their burrows. They also use them to make doors within those burrows so they can effectively hide in them from predators.        
				There are some species of spider in the world that live in trees and they will make funnel-shaped webs to live in and then live within the center of it, but other than that, a tarantula spider web has no shape because they donâ€™t make them. If you were to run into a tarantula burrow, however, you could very likely see the spider silk they have used to line their home.

                Diet: Tarantulas are nocturnal hunters. They feed primarily on insects like grasshoppers, beetles, other small spiders and arthropods, and will sometimes eat small lizards. They will attempt to overcome anything of the right size that moves in their range. Most tarantulas have weak venom.
